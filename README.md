# PI-car
Embedded systems project, simple car design which can be controlled by a adroid or desktop app. It can mesure the distance of objects in front of it, and stop if there is something blocking it path.
The whole project was made using C and C++ and for the UI I used Qt. The server and client were custom made in C.
