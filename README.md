# PI-car
Embedded systems project, simple car design which can be controlled by a adroid or desktop app. It can mesure the distance of objects in front of it, and stop if there is something blocking it path.
The whole project was made using C and C++ and for the UI I used Qt. The server and client were custom made in C.

## Files
- Raspberry pi folder contains the pi code
- Desktop app is the app for desktop created in Qt
- Mobile app is the app created for android in Qt

## How it works

Just connect to the same network and boot up the app either on your smartphone or pc, and connect to the raspberry pi that controlls your car.
